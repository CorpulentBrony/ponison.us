# PoniSonus - Pony Sound Generator

[This site](https://ponison.us) represents a crazy idea I had to allow for the creation of customized sound files with selected sounds randomly interspersed according to the user's settings on file generation. I think it just may be crazy enough to work if I put in the effort to generate the sound stubs (which will likely not be available via github, sorry).
